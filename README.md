# Minimum-Wage-DiD-Analysis

This analysis highlights the role of Difference-in-Differences (DiD) as a powerful econometric method for evaluating policy impacts. By comparing employment trends in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, we isolate the causal effect of the minimum wage increase while accounting for shared time trends and pre-existing differences. The findings challenge traditional economic theories suggesting that higher minimum wages reduce employment, offering evidence that such policies may not harm job growth in certain industries like fast food. This work demonstrates the importance of robust statistical methods in informing policy debates and economic decision-making.
